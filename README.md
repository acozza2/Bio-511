“This multi-year study quantifies the distribution and density of aquatic vertebrates throughout Lookout Creek stream network, including Mack, McRae and Upper Lookout Creeks. We are examining how predictable and consistent the densities and sizes of cutthroat trout and coastal giant salamanders are throughout the network and whether they fluctuate synchronously with vertebrates sizes and densities in Mack Creek that have been measured since 1987 (AS006). We are also examining biomass and condition of individuals across sites. Density and developmental stage of coastal tailed frog tadpoles are noted. We use electroshocking in discrete blocked reaches (depletion and mark-recapture methodologies) to collect individuals that are then weighed, measured and released. Site specific characteristics are measured at each sampling event, including wetted widths and water depths. Broader landscape metrics, including stream gradient and watershed area, were calculated for sites.”

I do not know what statistical analysis I will do with this yet.
